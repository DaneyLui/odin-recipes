                <p><h2>PREPARE THE OREO CRUST</h2></p>
                <p>I like to bake my crust as it helps ensure it is tightly sealed and crispy</p>
                
                <p>   MAKE A CHOCOLATE GANACHE
                Mix chocolate, cream and coffee over a double boiler. Set it aside to cool as you prepare the rest of the cheesecake batter

                MAKE THE CHEESECAKE BATTER
                First mix the cream cheese until it is creamy, then add the sugar, cocoa, salt and vanilla and mix for 3-5 minutes until everything is smooth.
            </p>
            <p>   During this process, it is important to keep scraping the bowl so there aren't any lumps of cream cheese in the batter. Then add the eggs and whisk, followed by the cooled down ganache and sour cream. Lightly mix until everything is combined, taking care not to overmix at this point as we don't want to introduce extra air into the batter.

                BAKE THE CHEESECAKE
                Pour the batter into the pan with the crust. Cover the pan tightly with 2-3 sheets of aluminum foil on the bottom and edges (do not cover the top), to help ensure no water leaks in. Then place it in the oven in a larger pan that has 1-2 inches of boiling water.
            </p>
            <p>   The water bath helps ensure the cheesecake cooks slowly and evenly, and doesn't form cracks on the surface.
            </p>
            <p>   LET IT COOL!
                I know it's hard to be patient, but you really do have to wait overnight (at least 8 hours) before diving into cheesecake. Otherwise the texture is not going to be set
            </p>
            <p>   DECORATE AND ENJOY!
                Make some more ganache and chocolate whipped cream, and decorate your cheesecake. And you can finally dive in!</p></div>
